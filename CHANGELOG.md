# Changelog

All notable changes to **libs** (shared Go libraries for the spore.host tools)
are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.37.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `update.CheckNow(tool, currentVersion) *Result` — a synchronous, ungated
  version check for explicit, user-initiated use (e.g. a `version` subcommand).
  Unlike `CheckAsync` it ignores the CI / `SPORE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` / non-TTY
  suppressions and bypasses the 24h cache, so the caller always gets a fresh
  answer; returns nil when the GitHub releases API can't be reached.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-06-07

Latest tagged release. See the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/spore-host/libs/releases) for the contents
of this and earlier tags (`update`, `i18n`, `catalog`, `pricing` packages).
